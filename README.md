### Running local

You're going to need to run the json-server and also the ng server. In separated terminals just run:

```bash
npm run server
ng serve
```


### Running unit tests
In order to run the unit tests you just need to open the project and run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
ng test
```


### Running e2e tests
You're going to need to run the json-server (test version) and also the e2e command. In separeted terminals just run:

```bash
npm run e2e-server
ng e2e
```

Thanks :D
